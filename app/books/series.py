"""Filling the gaps in a series the library already holds part of.

EchoFin's series screen lists the books of one series this library has, in
reading order, and the natural question on it is "where are the others".
Listenarr can monitor a whole series, but its library is only what it has
bought, so monitoring would re-acquire every book already on the shelf -- the
architecture rule at the top of `listenarr.py` exists to stop exactly that.
This module answers the question against Jellyfin instead: which of the books
Audible files under this series are not here, and asks for only those, one at
a time, through the same path a single request takes. Every guard on that path
-- the allowance, the duplicate check, the ledger, the immediate search --
applies to each book as if it had been asked for on its own.
