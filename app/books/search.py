"""Direct catalogue search, for the book somebody already has in mind.

The shelves answer "what should I read next". This answers "do we have, or can
we get, *this*" -- which no amount of similarity ranking can, because the whole
point is that the listener names the book.

Audible's own `?keywords=` returns nothing unauthenticated, so the query goes
through Listenarr, whose provider is authenticated. That is the same route the
keyword-discovery channel already uses; it borrows Listenarr's search, never its
library, so Jellyfin remains the single library of record.

Owned books are *marked*, not hidden. On the Discover shelf an owned book is
noise and is filtered out. In a search it is the answer: somebody typing a title
wants to know it is already here, and silence would read as "we cannot get it".
