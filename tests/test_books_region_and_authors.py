"""The marketplace, and the author check that decides "we already own this".

Both are the same bug seen from two sides: on 2026-08-27 the Discover shelf
offered Demon World Boba Shop to the account that already had all five books.

ASIN, and even given the right store, "RC Joshua" and "R. C. Joshua" did not
match each other.
