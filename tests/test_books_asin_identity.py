"""An ASIN lookup must never answer with a different book.

On 2026-08-28 a request for "I Ran Away to Evil: A Cozy LitRPG Rom-Com" put a
record in Listenarr with an empty title. Listenarr searched on what it had,
scored "The Waste Lands" as ACCEPTABLE at 100, and downloaded Dark Tower III --
which then imported under `Unknown Author/Unknown Title` because it matched
nothing either. The listener got a book from a series they were not reading,
and their daily request allowance was spent on it.
