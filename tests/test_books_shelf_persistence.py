"""The shelf must never make somebody wait twice for the same twelve seconds.

Measured on the live server 2026-08-27: a cold build is 12.6s, of which 9.5s is
one Jellyfin listing of 3,352 books. It is that slow because it asks for
`People`, and it cannot stop: 414 books here carry an Author person and no
AlbumArtist, so dropping the field would lose their author outright.
