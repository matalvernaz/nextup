"""The book engine's own state: suppression, dismissal expiry, attribution.

The audiobook service's suite, carried across with the engine it tests. One
section is deliberately gone: it exercised a migration from that service's
original single-user tables, a shape no database of this one has ever had.
The rekeying onto Jellyfin account ids is still here, because that one matters
and now has six more tables to move than it used to.
